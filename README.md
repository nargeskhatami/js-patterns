This repo is related to the [FrontendMasters workshop on JavaScript Patterns](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/tour-js-patterns), which is split up into four parts:

 - Design Patterns
 - React Patterns
 - Rendering Patterns
 - Performance Patterns

The content is based on [Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev) - a free online resource on design patterns and component patterns for building powerful web apps with vanilla JavaScript and React.
